      <h2>Last Updated: January 27, 2020</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
      This <strong>Privacy Policy for California Residents</strong> is
      provided by BackThenHistory and its affiliates ("BackThenHistory", "We",
      "Our", "Us"), and applies solely to the Personal
      Information (as defined below in Section 1) that We collect and use
      relating to consumers and users who reside in the State of California
      ("Users," " Consumers" or "You"). This
      Privacy Policy is applicable to the publications, businesses, websites
      and mobile applications operated by BackThenHistory, including the site from which
      You accessed this Privacy Policy (Our websites and mobile applications
      are collectively referred to as "Sites"). It also applies to
      the related online services that We provide through Our Sites (the
      "Services"). We provide this Privacy Policy to comply with
      California privacy laws, including the California Consumer Privacy Act
      of 2018 (CCPA).
    </p>
    <p>
      By using Our Sites and/or Our Services, and providing Us with Personal
      Information You agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy
      and Our <a href="/cookie">Cookie Policy</a> referenced below
      and to the updates to these policies posted here from time to time. To
      make sure You stay informed of all changes, You should check these
      policies periodically. Updates will be referenced by the "Last

    </p>
    <h2>1. DEFINITION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
    <p>
      For purposes of this Privacy Policy, except where a different definition
      is noted, <strong>"Personal Information"</strong> means
      information that identifies, relates to, describes, references, is
      reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be
      linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer, household,
      or device.
    </p>
    <p>Personal Information does not include:</p>
    <ul>
      <p>
        </p><li>Publicly available information from government records.</li>
        <li>De-identified or aggregated consumer information.</li>
        <li>
          Other information excluded from the CCPA's scope, such as:
        </li>
        <li>
          Health or medical information covered by the Health Insurance
          Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and the
          California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (CMIA) or
          clinical trial data;
        </li>
        <li>
          Personal information covered by certain sector-specific privacy
          laws, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), the
          Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) or California Financial Information
          Privacy Act (FIPA), and the Driver's Privacy Protection Act of
          1994.
        </li>
      <p></p>
    </ul>
    <h2>2. CALIFORNIA "SHINE THE LIGHT" LAW</h2>
    <p>
      California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "Shine The
      Light" law, permits consumers who are California residents, to
      request and obtain from Us once a year, free of charge, information
      about the categories of personal information (as defined in the Shine
      the Light law), if any, that We disclosed in the preceding calendar year
      to third parties for those third parties' direct marketing
      purposes.
      <strong>
        Our disclosure requirements apply only if We share Our consumers'
        personal information with third parties for them to directly market
        their own products to those consumers, instead of assisting Us with
        Our own business.
      </strong>
      If You are a California resident and would like to make such a request,
      contact Us as provided in the "Contact Us" section below.
    </p>
    <h2>3. CCPA Disclosures and Rights; Do Not Sell</h2>
    <h3>3.1 Personal Information We collect</h3>
    <p>
      We may have collected Personal Information in the following categories
      from consumers within the last twelve (12) months. The categories and
      examples provided in the chart below are those defined in the CCPA. This
      does not mean that all examples of that category of Personal Information
      were in fact collected but reflects Our good faith belief to the best of
      Our knowledge that some of that information may have been collected
      about consumers. We will update this disclosure from time to time as
      appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
      In response to a verified consumer request for categories of information
      collected, We will investigate and provide an individualized response to
      the consumer, and will not merely refer the consumer to Our general
      practices outlined in this Privacy Policy unless Our response would be
      the same for all consumers and this Privacy Policy discloses all the
      information that is otherwise required for the response to such a
      consumer request.

    <h3>3.2 Sources of Personal Information</h3>
    <p>
      We obtain the categories of Personal Information listed above from the
      following categories of sources:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <p>
        </p><li>
          Directly from You. For example, during account registration from
          forms You complete, subscriptions You purchase or comments You
          provide on Our Sites.
        </li>
        <li>
          Indirectly from You. For example, from observing your actions on Our
          Sites.
        </li>
        <li>
          From third parties. For example, third party social networking
          providers and advertising companies, Our affiliates and service
          providers who provide services or information to Us. If You do not
          want Us to collect information from social networks, You should
          review and adjust your privacy settings on those networks as desired
          before linking or connecting them to Our Sites.
        </li>
        <li>
          From publicly available sources. For example, online database
          searches.
        </li>
      <p></p>
    </ul>
    <h3>3.3 Use and Disclosure ("Sale") of Personal Information</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>
        As defined by the CCPA 1738.140(t)-(2)(C), BackThenHistory
        does not "sell" your Personal Information and only shares
        that information with Our Service Providers for the purpose of making
        contact with You.
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      We may have "sold" (as that term is defined in the CCPA)
      Personal Information in the following categories from consumers within
      the last twelve (12) months. Please note that the CCPA uses an expanded
      definition of the term, in which "sell" means:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making
      available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in writing,
      or by electronic or other means, a consumer's personal information
      by the business to a third party for valuable consideration; or (B)
      sharing orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a
      consumer's personal information with a third party, whether for
      valuable consideration or for no consideration, for the third
      party's commercial purposes."
    </p>
    <p>
      When We disclose that We may have sold Personal Information, it means
      that We may have received some kind of benefit to Our company in return
      for sharing Personal Information, but not necessarily received any money
      in exchange.
    </p>
    <p>
      The categories below are those defined in the CCPA.
      <strong>
        This does not mean that all examples of that category of Personal
        Information were in fact "sold" but reflects Our good faith
        belief to the best of Our knowledge that some of that information may
        have been shared for value in return.
      </strong>
      We will update this disclosure from time to time as appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
      In response to a verified consumer request for categories of Personal
      Information "sold," We will investigate and provide an
      individualized response to the consumer, and will not merely refer the
      consumer to Our general practices outlined in this Privacy Policy unless
      Our response would be the same for all consumers and this Privacy Policy
      discloses all the information that is otherwise required for the
      response to such a consumer request.

      Our assets, in which Personal Information We hold is among the assets
      transferred.
    </p>
    <p>
      If We decide to collect additional categories of Personal Information or
      use the Personal Information We collected for materially different,
      unrelated, or incompatible purposes We will update this Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In response to a verified consumer request to know what Personal
      Information was collected or sold, We will investigate and provide an
      individualized response to the consumer, which will include the business
      or commercial purpose for collecting and/or sharing that information. We
      will not merely refer the consumer to Our general practices outlined in
      this Privacy Policy unless Our response would be the same for all
      consumers and this Privacy Policy discloses all the information that is
      otherwise required for the response to such a consumer request.

          using the information for internal purposes that a consumer might
          reasonably expect.
        </li>
      <p></p>
    </ol>
    <p>
      After We receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, We will
      delete your Personal Information from Our records within the time period
      required by the CCPA, unless an exception applies.
    </p>
    <p>
      To exercise your Right to Delete as described above, please contact Us
      as provided in the “Contact Us” section below.
    </p>
    <h3>3.6.1 Exercising Your Rights</h3>
    <p>
      To exercise the rights described above, please contact Us as provided in
      the “Contact Us” section below.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data
        portability twice within a 12-month period.
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The verifiable consumer request must provide sufficient information that
      allows Us to reasonably verify You are the person about whom We
      collected personal information or an authorized representative, which
      may include:
      <strong>
        providing your email and phone verification, known customer
        information, and/or account sign-up authentication or other
        information needed to verify your identity depending on the
        sensitivity of the Personal Information in question.
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      We cannot respond to your request or provide You with Personal
      Information if We cannot verify your identity or authority to make the
      request and confirm the Personal Information relates to You.
    </p>
    <p>
      Making a verifiable consumer request does not require You to create an
      account with Us. We will only use Personal Information provided in a
      verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or
      authority to make the request.
    </p>
    <h3>3.6.2 Response Timing and Format</h3>
    <p>
      We use good faith efforts to respond to a verifiable consumer request
      within forty-five (45) days after its receipt. If We need more time (up
      to 90 days), We will inform You of the reason and the needed extension
      period in writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      If You have an account with Us, We will deliver Our written response to
      that account. If You do not have an account with Us, We will deliver Our
      written response by email.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any disclosures We provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding
      the verifiable consumer request's receipt. If We cannot comply with
      any portion of a request, the response We provide will also explain why,
      if applicable. For data portability requests, We will select a
      commercially reasonable format to provide your Personal Information that
      is commonly useable and should allow You to transmit the information
      from one entity to another entity without hindrance, but We do not
      guarantee that all formats are useable in all media. We do not charge a
      fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it
      is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If We determine that
      the request warrants a fee, We will tell You why We made that decision
      and provide You with a cost estimate before completing your request.
    </p>
    <h3>3.6.3 Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of CCPA Privacy Rights</h3>
    <p>
      We will not discriminate against You for exercising any of your CCPA
      rights. In particular, We will not:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <p>
        </p><li>Deny You goods or services</li>
        <li>
          Charge You different prices for goods or services, whether through
          denying benefits or imposing penalties
        </li>
        <li>
          Provide You with a different level or quality of goods or services
        </li>
        <li>Threaten You with any of the above</li>
      <p></p>
    </ul>
    <h3>3.7 Do Not Sell My Personal Information.</h3>
    <p>
      The CCPA requires businesses to provide a web page where consumers can
      opt out of the "sale" of their Personal Information.
      <strong>
        BackThenHistory does not sell your personal information and therefore is not
        required to provide such a web page.
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, You may opt out of certain interest-based dvertising by
      using the following resources:
    </p>
    <p>
      (a) You may opt-out of tracking and receiving tailored advertisements on
      your mobile device by some mobile advertising companies and other
      similar entities by downloading the App Choices app at
      "www.aboutads.info/appchoices."
    </p>
    <p>
      (b) You may opt-out of receiving permissible targeted advertisements by
      using the NAI Opt-out tool available at optout.networkadvertising.org or
      visiting About Ads.
    </p>
    <p>
      (c) You may opt-out of having your activity on Our Sites and Services
      made available to Google Analytics by installing the Google Analytics
      opt-out add-on for your web browser by visiting:
      tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout for your web browser.
    </p>
    <h2>4. CALIFORNIA DO NOT TRACK DISCLOSURE</h2>
    <p>
      We do not currently respond to browser Do Not Track signals or other
      browser or device based mechanisms that provide a method to opt out of
      the collection of information across the networks of websites and online
      services in which We participate. Unless and until the law requires Us
      to respond to browser Do Not Track signals, We will not respond to those
      signals as an opt out, but if We do so in the future, We will describe
      how We do so here. However, We do provide consumers with the ability to
      manage their cookie choices as described in Our
      <a href="/cookie">Cookie Policy</a>. For more information on
      Do Not Track, please visit allaboutdnt.com.
    </p>
    <h2>5. DO WE USE "COOKIES"?</h2>
    <p>
      Yes. Cookies and similar technologies are small files that a website or
      its service provider transfers to a computer's hard drive through a
      Web browser (if the user allows) that enables the website's or
      service provider's systems to recognize the user's browser and
      capture and remember certain information.
    </p>
    <p>
      In general, We and Our third party providers and advertisers, use
      cookies and other technologies to optimize the functionality of the
      Sites, to help Us understand how the Sites are used and to provide users
      with interest-based content or advertising based upon their browsing
      activities and interests.
    </p>

        Our affiliates and third party providers and advertisers use on Our

    </p>
    <h2>6. SECURITY</h2>
    <p>
      We use commercially reasonable procedures and various technical,
      administrative and physical safeguards to help protect the
      confidentiality of Personal Information. However, no data transmitted
      over the Internet or stored or maintained by Us or Our third-party
      service providers can be 100% secure given the reality of communication
      via technology systems. Therefore, although We believe the measures
      implemented by us are commercially reasonable and reduce the likelihood
      of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data
      involved, We do not promise or guarantee, and You should not expect,
      that your Personal Information or private communications sent to Us over
      those systems will always remain private or secure. We are not
      responsible for the circumvention of any privacy settings or security
      features.
    </p>
    <p>
      If You believe that your Personal Information has been accessed or
      acquired by an unauthorized person, please promptly Contact Us so that
      necessary measures can quickly be taken.
    </p>
    <h2>7. THIRD PARTY LINKS</h2>
    <p>
      Our Sites or Services may contain links to other websites or services
      that are not owned or controlled by Us, including links to social media
      platforms, or may redirect You off Our Sites away from our Services to
      other websites for information or other services. This Privacy Policy
      only applies to information collected by Our Sites and Services. We are
      not responsible for the privacy and security practices of those other
      websites or social media platforms or the information they may collect
      (which may include IP address). You should refer to such third
      parties&amp;apos privacy policies on their sites to determine their
      respective privacy practices. Links to any other websites or content do
      not constitute or imply an endorsement or recommendation by Us of the
      linked website, social media platform, and/or content.
    </p>
    <h2>8. CHILDREN</h2>
    <p>
      These Sites are not intended for use by children under the age of 13.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, We do not knowingly collect information from children under
      the age of 16, although certain third party sites that We link to may do
      so. These third-party sites have their own terms of use and privacy
      policies and We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their
      children’s Internet usage and to help enforce Our Privacy Policy by
      instructing their children to never provide information on Our Sites
      without their permission.
    </p>
    <p>
      Involvement of parents: In accordance with the provisions of the
      Children’s Online Privacy Act, in the event that We do begin collecting
      any Personal Information or data from children under the age of 13, We
      will notify parents first, and will seek parental or guardian consent to
      collect, use and/or disclose certain Personal Information from children
      under the age of 13. A parent may review and have deleted their child’s
      Personal Information, and may refuse to permit further collection or use
      of their child’s information by contacting Us as noted at the end of
      this Privacy Policy. Parents may consent to our collection and use of
      their child’s Personal Information without consenting to the disclosure
      of that information to others.
    </p>
    <p>
      If You have reason to believe that a child under the age of 16 has
      provided Personal Information to Us through Our Sites without the
      appropriate consent, please Contact Us with sufficient detail to enable
      Us to delete that information from Our databases.
    </p>
    <h2>9. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
    <p>
      We may amend this Privacy Policy at Our discretion and at any time. When
      We make changes to this Privacy Policy, We will post the updated notice
      on Our Sites and update the notice's "Last Updated" date.
      Your continued use of Our Sites and/or Services following the posting of
      changes constitutes your acceptance of such changes.
