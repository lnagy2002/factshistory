    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This cookie policy ("Cookie Policy") describes the cookies and
      other technologies used by BackThenHistory ("BackThenHistory", "We",
      "Us", or "Our") on Our sites that post this policy
      (collectively, "Sites").
    </p>
    <p>
      We have created this Cookie Policy to explain what these technologies
      are and why We use them, as well as your rights to control Our use of
      them. This Cookie Policy forms part of Our Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that We include references in this Cookie Policy to other
      websites that provide information about cookies and about opt-out
      choices. We are not affiliated with those sites or the third parties
      that operate them. We are not responsible for the content on those
      sites, and provide links to them for information and convenience only.
      By using the Sites, You consent to the practices described in this
      Cookie Policy and Our Privacy Policy BackThenHistory and to the updates to these
      policies posted here from time to time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certain cookies that are necessary for the operation of the Sites do not
      require your consent (see below in the "Strictly Necessary
      Cookies" Section). To make sure You stay informed of all changes,
      You should check these policies periodically. Updates will be referenced
      by the "Last Updated" date shown above.
    </p>
    <h2>What Is a "Cookie"?</h2>
    <p>
      We often place a small file known as a "cookie" on Your
      computer's hard drive. A cookie may contain information that allows
      Us to track Your path through the Sites and to determine whether You
      have visited Us before. However, unless You provide Us with personally
      identifiable information, the cookies will not contain any information
      that would allow Us to personally identify You. If You do provide
      personally identifiable information to Us, the cookie is tied to this
      information so that Our systems will recognize You each time You use the
      Sites. In that way, We can save Your preferences from visit to visit and
      present You with a customized version of the Sites every time You visit.
      Our cookies cannot be used to read data from Your hard drive and cannot
      retrieve information from any other cookies created by other sites. We
      use cookies in this manner to help Us understand how Users use the
      Sites, and to help Us to improve the Sites.
    </p>

      similar things.
    </p>

    </p>
    <h3>How are cookies used for advertising purposes?</h3>
    <p>
      Cookies and other ad technology such as beacons, pixels, and tags help
      Us market more effectively to users that We and Our partners believe may
      be interested in the Sites. They also help provide Us with aggregated
      auditing, research, and reporting, and know when content has been shown
      to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      We target (and measure the performance of) ads to Members, Visitors and
      others, both on and off of Our Services through a variety of ad networks
      and ad exchanges, using the following, whether separately or combined:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <p>
        </p><li>
          Advertising technologies on and off of Our Services, like web
          beacons, pixels, ad tags, cookies, and mobile identifiers as
          permitted by mobile platforms;
        </li>
        <li>Account information and contact information and categories;</li>
        <li>
          Information inferred from account information (for example, names to
          infer gender);
        </li>
        <li>
          Your use of Our Services (for example, Your search history, which
          pages You visit, Your clicking on a BackThenHistory ad, etc.) and log files
          generated as described in the Log Files Section;
        </li>
        <li>
          Information from third parties (e.g. advertising partners,

          information from Our cookies (and similar technologies), Your
          account and use of Our Services.
        </li>
      <p></p>

    <h3>
      What can You do if You don't want cookies to be set or want them to
      be removed, or if You want to opt out of interest-based targeting?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Some people prefer not to allow cookies, which is why most browsers give
      You the ability to manage cookies to suit you. In some browsers You can
      set up rules to manage cookies on a site-by-site basis, giving you more
      fine-grained control over your privacy. What this means is that You can
      disallow cookies from all sites except those that You trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Browser manufacturers provide help pages relating to cookie management
      in their products. Please see below for more information.

    <h2>Cookies and Other Technologies</h2>
    <h3>Different Durations of Cookies</h3>
    <p>
      Cookies can be stored on your computer for different periods of time.
      "Session cookie" only last for as long as the browser session
      and are deleted automatically once You close your browser.
      "Persistent cookies" cookies survive after your browser is
      closed until a defined expiration date set in the cookie (as determined
      by the party placing it), and help recognize your computer when You open
      your browser and browse the Internet again.
    </p>
    <h3>First Party and Third Party Cookies</h3>
    <p>
      First party cookies are placed on a website directly by the owner of the
      Site, in this case,
      BackThenHistory. Third party cookies are placed on a website by third party
      providers (for example, by companies that provide advertising tracking
      or web analytics services) and by advertisers on the Site. We use both
      first-party cookies as well as third-party cookies.
    </p>
    <h3>Pixel Tags</h3>
    <p>
      We also use pixel tags (usually in combination with cookies), from the
      third parties, to get information about your usage of the Sites and
      about your interaction with email or other communications. Pixel tags
      are a technology similar to cookies that can be embedded in online
      content or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking
      activity on websites (for example, to know when content has been shown
      to You), or to know when You have viewed particular content or a
      particular email message.
    </p>
    <h2>Cookie List</h2>
    <p>
      Our use of cookies, as defined above, are further categorized into the
      following types:
    </p>
    <h3>Strictly Necessary Cookies</h3>
    <p>
      These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be
      switched off in Our systems. They are usually only set in response to
      actions made by You which amount to a request for services, such as
      setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms. You
      can set your browser to block or alert You about these cookies, but some
      parts of the Sites will not then work. These cookies do not store any
      personally identifiable information.
    </p>
    <h3>Performance Cookies</h3>
    <p>
      These cookies allow Us to count visits and traffic sources so We can
      measure and improve the performance of Our Sites. They help Us to know
      which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move
      around the Sites. All information these cookies collect is aggregated
      and therefore anonymous.
    </p>
    <h3>Functional Cookies</h3>
    <p>
      These cookies enable the Sites to provide enhanced functionality and
      personalization. They may be set by Us or by third party providers whose
      services We have added to Our pages.
